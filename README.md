# Network-Model-Onchocerciasis
A model using network simulations to better understand the effects of various factors on the transmission of Onchocerciases and other NTDs

The code in this Repo provides two models for incorporating social dynamics in the spread of vector-human disesaes, such as Onchocericiasis. It uses Erdos Renyi graphs wih triadic closure to model friendship dynamics, and allows individual to change certain characteristics based on a 'birds of a feather' approach where the more friends you have from a risk category the more your risk of infection

Code from a project with the Rosalind Cornforth at the Walker Institute in Reading
